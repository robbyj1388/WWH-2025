# Robby - Winter Wonder Hack 2025

Robby is an interactive and animated character created for Winter Wonder Hack 2025. This project uses Python's `pygame`, `tkinter`, and `PIL` libraries to create a character that can move around the screen, change states (talking, dragon form, idle), and respond to user interactions. The project features random events, smooth animations, sound effects, and more.

## Features
- **Interactive Movement**: Robby can be dragged around the screen with the mouse. Different sounds are played based on Robby's state (e.g., "scream" for normal mode, "rawr" for dragon form).
- **State Changes**: Robby can randomly switch between talking, dragon form, and idle mode every 30 seconds. Sounds and animations change accordingly.
- **Random Movement**: Robby moves to random positions on the screen at intervals, adding an element of unpredictability to the interaction.
- **Folder Icon Mode**: Double-click Robby to hide him as a folder icon, with the window remaining active and interactive.
- **Sound Effects**: Various sound effects are triggered based on Robby's actions, such as talking, transforming, and flying.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Robby moves smoothly across the screen, creating a more polished and engaging user experience.

- `pygame`
